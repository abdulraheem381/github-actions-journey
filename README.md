# 🚀 GitHub Actions Journey

Welcome to my **GitHub Actions Learning Journey**!
Over the next few weeks, I’ll be learning **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** step by step, and documenting everything here.

This repo is structured **day by day** — each day introduces a new concept, along with a working workflow you can try out yourself.

## 📂 Repo Structure

```
.github/
 └── workflows/
      ├── day01-hello-world.yml
      ├── day02-triggers.yml
      ├── day03-jobs-steps.yml
      └── ...
docs/
 ├── day01-intro.md
 ├── day02-triggers.md
 └── ...
README.md
```

* **`.github/workflows/`** → contains the actual workflow files (you can copy or run them directly in your forked repo).
* **`docs/`** → contains short notes/diagrams that explain the day’s learning (blogs will have the full explanation).
* **`README.md`** → this file is your navigation hub.

👉 Each day is **incremental** — start from Day 01 and move forward.
