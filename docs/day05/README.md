# Day 05 â€“ Outputs in GitHub Actions

In this demo, weâ€™ll learn how to use **outputs** in GitHub Actions to pass data between jobs.

## Steps

1. **Set an output in Job 1**
   - Weâ€™ll generate a value (like a build ID or timestamp).
   - Store it as an output using `echo "name=value" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`.

2. **Consume the output in Job 2**
   - Access it with `needs.<job_id>.outputs.<output_name>`.
