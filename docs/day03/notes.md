# Day 03 – Events & Triggers

## What are Events & Triggers?
- **Event**: An activity in your repo (push, pull_request, issues, etc.).
- **Trigger**: The signal that tells GitHub Actions to start the workflow.

## Activity Types
- Fine-grained control over when workflows run.
- Example: `pull_request` → [opened, closed, edited]

## Filters
- Control when workflows fire:
  - `branches`
  - `branches-ignore`
  - `paths`
